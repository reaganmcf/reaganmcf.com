Prompt 1:

```
My name is Reagan McFarland. I'm a professional software engineer in the finance industry with a passion for programming languages, and solving complicated problems. I want to build a brand new personal portfolio website using React, Vite, and Tailwind. I have already set up a brand new project with all of the correct dependencies. The site should serve tw purposes:

1. A place to show off my work
2. A place for me to posts blogs about things I care about

I want the site to have a very clean aesthetic, and have very smooth and tasteful animations using the Framer motion react library.

The home page should have the following:

1. A menu bar at the top with a section for "projects" and "blog"
1. The top portion should have a short introduction of who I am
2. a 2x2 grid of cards showcasing a few of my projects.

Feel free to mock out the components. I just want you to create the home page right now and I will ask you in the future to build out the components themselves.

Please build the home page as a react component
```

My feedback:

Really nailed it on the "over the top" animation style
I shouldve specified more about the overall look but it did what I asked for


--- 

Prompt 2:

```
Can you refactor "Home.tsx" to use Tailwindcss? From now on, all styles should be inline tailwind class names instead of in a separate file
```

Refactored it exactly how I wanted


---

Prompt 3:

```
I want to have a really pretty looking card component for each project called `ProjectCard`. I will modify to the Home page to use this component myself, you just have to create the component.

The component should have a preview image, a title and a description that is a few lines. Clicking on the card should expand into a modal (using framer motion for smooth transitions) that expands to the full description. 

This component should also take a githubUrl property, and show have a small github icon that when clicked will navigate to the url in a new tab.

When not expanded, the image should take up most of the card, with text and description under neath the image.

When expanded, the image and title should be on the left side of the card, and the right side a full description.
```

It didn't really make what I wanted. 
- Didn't make a full page modal when clicked, just kept its size
- Weird flex issues with the card
- Forgot to mention to use typescript


---

I've upgdated the ProjectCard component to the following:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

interface IProjectCard {
  title: string;
  description: string;
  imageUrl: string;
  githubUrl: string;
}

const ProjectCard: React.FC<IProjectCard> = ({
  title,
  description,
  imageUrl,
  githubUrl,
}) => {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  const toggleExpanded = () => {
    setIsExpanded(!isExpanded);
  };

  const navigateToGithub = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    window.open(githubUrl, "_blank");
  };

  const cardContent = (
    <div className="flex flex-col">
      <img src={imageUrl} alt={title} className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />
      <div className="mt-4">
        <h3 className="text-xl font-semibold">{title}</h3>
        <p className="mt-2 text-sm">{description.slice(0, 100)}...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  const expandedContent = (
    <div className="flex">
      <div className="w-1/2">
        <img src={imageUrl} alt={title} className="w-full h-48 object-cover" />
        <h3 className="mt-4 text-xl font-semibold">{title}</h3>
      </div>
      <div className="w-1/2 ml-4">
        <p className="text-sm">{description}</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  return (
    <motion.div
      layout
      onClick={toggleExpanded}
      className="border border-gray-300 rounded p-4 relative cursor-pointer"

      exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
    >
      <AnimatePresence>
        {!isExpanded && (
          <motion.div
            key="cardContent"
            exit={{ opacity: 0 }}
            className="absolute top-0 left-0 w-full h-full"
          >
            {cardContent}

        )}
      </AnimatePresence>

      <AnimatePresence>

          </svg>
        </div>
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  );
};

export default ProjectCard;
```

From now on, please use Typescript instead of Javascript.

Replace the "preview project" section of the home page component to use the new Project Card component. Make sure it is responsive and doesn't have any layout issues.

For the project data, I will fill it in myself.


_This didn't fix anything_

---

There seems to be an issue where the Project Cards on the home page are overlapping eachother. Please fix Project Card component to prevent this.

This is the current version of the project card component:

```
import React, { useState } from "react";
import { motion, AnimatePresence } from "framer-motion";

  description,
  imageUrl,
  githubUrl,
}) => {
  const [isExpanded, setIsExpanded] = useState(false);

  const toggleExpanded = () => {
    setIsExpanded(!isExpanded);
  };

  const navigateToGithub = (e: React.MouseEvent<HTMLElement>) => {
    e.stopPropagation();
    window.open(githubUrl, "_blank");
  };

  const cardContent = (

        <p className="mt-2 text-sm">{description.slice(0, 100)}...</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  );

  const expandedContent = (

    </div>
  );

        </div>
      </div>
    </motion.div>
  );
};

export default ProjectCard;
```

_This was actually really surprising and it did in fact find the bug which was really awesome. However, it did fail to show the entire component and did cut off the final response but I was able to finish it for the AI._

---

When I click on a Project Card, I want the expanded content to be a modal that is on top of the entire page with padding on the side so it doesn't cover the entire screen. But, I want it to be on top of the page, like any other kind of modal that is traditionally on the web.

I want the modal opening to be animated using framer, where it "moves and expands" from the page on the screen to a full screen modal.

Also, on the notn expanded card, I don't want any padding between the image and the card, but I do for the text.


_Wasn't as pretty as I wanted but got it right. Although, it lost the github icon and I can't close the modal_

---

I want my website to have an animated background on every single page. I want the same pattern as isometric dot paper that translates in a random direction very slowly constantly.

How can I add this to my site?

_This was really interesting, and it seemed to get pretty close but not there_

---

There seems to be a fatal flaw in the IsometricDotBackground component. Instead of mvoing slowly across the screen they are glitching in a very small area. Also, it is not covering the entire screen. Instead of moving in a random way, just have it move across the screen in the positive x direction, but have it wrap so when it goes off the screen it starts over again in a smooth way.

_It was far closer this time, and some tinkering I got it over the finish line_

---

I like the project card when its not expanded, but I really don't like the layout of the component when it is expanded. I like that it is now a full screen modal, but I want it to look nicer and feel more professional. Take inspirtation from other really great portfolio websites and refactor the expanded view or the project-card component using tailwind

_I forgot to tell it that it doesn't close right now lol_
_I ended up just using the old component but with the new expnadedContent part_

---

I want to create a new "Tag" component that will be a small colored tag box with multiple color variants to differentiate tags and the tag value. It should assign a random tailwind color that is easily visible but not too bright or have to much contrast. two tag components with the same tag value should have the same color


---

I've added tailwindcss's typography plugin to get better rendering of the markdown content - now the Blog component looks like the following:

```
import React from 'react';
import { useLocation } from 'react-router-dom';
import { MDXProvider } from '@mdx-js/react';
import PageLayout from '../layout';

const components = {
  // Add any custom components you want to use in your MDX files
};

const BlogPost = () => {
  const location = useLocation();
  const slug = location.pathname.split('/').at(-1);
  const PostContent = React.lazy(() => import(`../../blog_posts/${slug}.md`));

  return (
    <PageLayout>
      <React.Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <MDXProvider components={components}>
        <article className="prose-lg">
          <PostContent />
          </article>
        </MDXProvider>
      </React.Suspense>
    </PageLayout>
  );
};

export default BlogPost;
```

I want to change it so that the code blocks have syntax highlighting and have a nice background. I want it to be themed using something like Gruvbox
